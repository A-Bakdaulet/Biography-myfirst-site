My first website on Github. 02.03.2025                * FIRST WEBSITE *
This is my very first personal website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a clean design, responsive layout, and basic interactive features. The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of web development, practice writing clean code, and experiment with styling and layout techniques.
